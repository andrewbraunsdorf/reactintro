Version1.0

React
JS library created by facebook
Also used by netflix and Instagram
Usesd to create JS-driven dynamic web apps
In that regard can be compared to Angular and Vue

Redux
A layer on top of React
Helps with State Management of our app
	Datain in the app
	UI state of the app
Is the menu open or closed

React basics
Componetnts events templates props and forms

React router
Routes, route paramenters, redirects

Redux
Stores, actions and reducers

Version 2.0
React
Components, Components, Components
Compents for Nav bar, Search Bar and Footer

Creates a js representation of the virtual dom
Takes virtual dom renders it to the DOM,

Idea heres is that when one of the component changes it renders it to the DOM very quickly because of the virtual DOM.
React creates a new virtual DOM and compares it to the OLD virtual DOM, and knows exact what it has to update in the actual DOM.

This happens every time, one of your component state changes.

Components and Templates
Components look like HTML templates (actually JSX)- JS XML
They can contain ”state” (data or UI State)
They can contain JS for functionality

Version 3.0
Package can create flow of whole pack with a full pack set up
  <!--Core react libary-->
  <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js"></script>
  <!--React DOM libary- glue layer between react and the dom. Its what lets us inject our components into the DOM-->
  
  <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>

Need both of the 2 libaries loaded into our index dot HTML Document

Packages
ES7 React/Redux GraphQL/React-Native Snippets
Sublime Babel

Version4.0
React components are the lifeblood of react and we use them to take control of different elements inside the navbar search bar contact form
Need to create class based components
Classes are a way for us to bluepring objects in JS

React Object Component to inherit all the base functionality of a component into this class
Class based components must have at least one function inside of them And that function is called render
Render is responsible for rendering our template to w.e element we want to render to return a value inside it is going to be the JSX template and is going to go inside paratheseses 
JSX allows us to write HTML code inside JS 

Can only have one root element
Cannot use class have to use className=
Take the glue layer that takes our components and can render them to the DOM is by saying react.  We don’t get access to that by here
When using ReactDOM.render() first parameter is which component we want to render to the DOM
We have to add it as a tag like ReactDOM.render(<App />, docment.getElementById(‘app’)) 
The second paramter is going to be where we want to render it to the DOM

JSX is normally not support in browers
Have to add type="text/babel" to <script type="text/babel"> before the dom
It doesnt get rid of it, it just nests our component inside that div

Idea of React is to actually output dynamic content
We can output dynamic JS content  inside these curly braces
Like take math object Math.random() * 10
Have to always use {}
So in
	<script type="text/babel">
		class App extends React.Component {
			render() {
				return (
					<div className="app-content">
					<h1> Hey, ninjas</h1>
					<p>{Math.random() * 10}</p>
					</div>
				);
			}
		}
		ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('app'))
	</script>
