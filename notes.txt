Version 2.0
React
Components, Components, Components
Compents for Nav bar, Search Bar and Footer

Creates a js representation of the virtual dom
Takes virtual dom renders it to the DOM,

Idea heres is that when one of the component changes it renders it to the DOM very quickly because of the virtual DOM.
React creates a new virtual DOM and compares it to the OLD virtual DOM, and knows exact what it has to update in the actual DOM.

This happens every time, one of your component state changes.

Components and Templates
Components look like HTML templates (actually JSX)- JS XML
They can contain ”state” (data or UI State)
They can contain JS for functionality
